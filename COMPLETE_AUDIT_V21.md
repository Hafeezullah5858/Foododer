# FoodOder V21 — Complete Audit / Build Status

## Verified from source
- Flutter Android project structure
- Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging, App Check, Crashlytics
- Customer cart, checkout, COD order creation, cancellation and reviews
- Vendor/Home Chef product management and order status flow
- Rider order acceptance, status updates and location streaming
- Admin order/user/home-chef views
- Firestore and Storage security rules
- CI workflow and release documentation

## V21 source fixes applied
1. App Check uses a debug provider in debug builds so local development is not blocked before production App Check registration.
2. Checkout TextEditingControllers are persistent and disposed correctly; this removes rebuild-related cursor/text-reset behavior.
3. App version is 1.5.0+7.

## Still requires external production setup
- Owner Firebase project deployment and credentials
- Restricted Google Maps API key and required APIs
- Firebase App Check production registration / Play Integrity
- Crashlytics activation/verification
- Firestore/Storage rules, indexes and Cloud Functions deployment
- Physical Android device testing
- Production Play App Signing/upload key
- Online payment merchant credentials + server-side webhook/signature verification (COD is the active payment method)

## Important
No honest audit can mark those external items as completed without access to the owner's Firebase/Google/Play accounts and a Flutter-capable build environment. The ZIP is therefore a production-ready source package after configuration, not proof of a published/live service.
